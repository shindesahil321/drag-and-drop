    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/canvas-clone.git
    cd canvas-clone
    ```

2. **Open the project in your favorite code editor.**

## Usage

1. **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**

    You can do this by simply double-clicking the `index.html` file or by running a local server using a tool like `Live Server` in VS Code.

2. **Interact with the Canvas:**

    - **Drag and Drop:**
        - Click and hold an element to drag it around the canvas.
        - Release the mouse button to drop the element in place.

    - **Add Elements:**
        - Use the provided interface to add new elements to the canvas.

    - **Remove Elements:**
        - Select an element and use the provided option to remove it from the canvas.

## Starting the Project

1. **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**

    You can start the project by opening the `index.html` file directly in a web browser. 

    - **Double-click** the `index.html` file in your file explorer.
    - Or, **right-click** and select `Open with` and choose your preferred web browser.

2. **Using a Local Server (Optional):**

    For a more dynamic development environment, you may want to use a local server. If you have Node.js installed, you can use `http-server` or a similar tool:

    - **Install `http-server` globally (if not already installed):**

        ```bash
        npm install -g http-server
        ```

    - **Start the server in the project directory:**

        ```bash
        http-server
        ```

    - **Open the URL provided by `http-server` in your web browser.** This is usually `http://localhost:8080`.
